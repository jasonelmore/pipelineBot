# pipelineBot
Board: ESP32 Dev Kit C |  Proof of concept for a gas and liquids pipeline inspection robot.  The robot uses a ultrasonic sensor to detect obstructions and to make range finding estimates.  A DHT11 provides temperature and humidity sensor data and can inform the operator of the environmental conditions the bot is operating in.  Data is published to a Mosquitto MQTT Broker and displayed in a node-red-dashboard user interface.
