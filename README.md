# pipelineBot
Board: ESP32 |  Proof of concept for a gas and liquids pipeline inspection robot.  The robot uses a ultrasonic sensor to detect obstructions and to make range finding estimates.  Temperature, and Humidity sensors give the operator vital information about the environmental conditions of the bot.  Data is published to a MQTT server running node-red.
